## **Features**
- **User Authentication:** Secure login using Spring Security.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Grant or restrict access based on user roles.
- **Token-Based Security:** Implements JWT for secure, stateless authentication.
- **Endpoint Protection:** Protects sensitive routes and allows public access to specific endpoints.
- **Modular Configuration:** Follows clean architecture with security configurations decoupled from business logic.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Java 17** (or compatible)
- **Spring Boot 3.x**
  - Spring Security
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data JPA
- **Hibernate** (for ORM)
- **H2 Database** (in-memory testing)
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** (for authentication)
- **Maven** (build tool)

---

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishabh-J08/VRV-_Security_Assignment.git
   cd VRV-_Security_Assignment
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

---

## **Configuration**
### **Application Properties**
The `application.properties` file in `src/main/resources` contains the default configuration. Update these as needed:
- **Server Port:** Change the default port:
  ```properties
  server.port=8080
  ```
- **JWT Secret Key:** Ensure you set a secure key for token signing:
  ```properties
  jwt.secret=your-secret-key
  ```

### **Database**
The application uses an in-memory H2 database. You can access the H2 console at:
- **URL:** `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
- **Default Credentials:**
  - Username: `sa`
  - Password: (leave blank)

## **Endpoints**
### **Authentication**
| HTTP Method | Endpoint          | Description                     |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| POST        | `/auth/login`     | Authenticate user and get token |
| POST        | `/auth/register`  | Register a new user             |

### **Protected Resources**
| HTTP Method | Endpoint          | Access Level    |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| GET         | `/api/private`    | Authenticated   |
| GET         | `/api/admin`      | Admin Only      |

### **Public Resources**
| HTTP Method | Endpoint          | Description       |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| GET         | `/public`         | Accessible by all |

---

## **Usage**
1. **Register a New User:**
   Send a POST request to `/auth/register` with:
   ```json
   {
       "username": "user",
       "password": "password",
       "role": "USER"
   }
   ```

2. **Login to Obtain JWT:**
   Send a POST request to `/auth/login` with:
   ```json
   {
       "username": "user",
       "password": "password"
   }
   ```

   The response will contain a JWT token:
   ```json
   {
       "token": "your-jwt-token"
   }
   ```

3. **Access Protected Resources:**
   Add the token to the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <your-jwt-token>`:
   ```http
   Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
   ```
